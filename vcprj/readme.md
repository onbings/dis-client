# My Markdown Document

This is an example of a Markdown document. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using plain text syntax.

## Features of Markdown

Markdown provides several features, including:

- **Headers**: You can use hash symbols (#) to create headings of different levels.
- **Emphasis**: You can make text *italic* by surrounding it with asterisks or underscores, and you can make it **bold** by using double asterisks or underscores.
- **Lists**: You can create ordered (numbered) or unordered (bullet) lists.
- **Links**: You can create links by enclosing the linked text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.
- **Images**: You can embed images using a similar syntax as links.
- **Code Blocks**: You can display code blocks using backticks or indentations.
- **Tables**: You can create tables to organize data.

## Sample Code

Here's an example of a code block in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")
